# PasteMe

This is a playground project.  
We wanted to experiment with Remote Pair Programming while doing BDD and Rails.

We picked up something that looked cool enough and that we could reasonably accomplish in about a week.

This is the result.

We'd like to hear if you find it interesting or at all useful.  
If you do, drop us a line :)
